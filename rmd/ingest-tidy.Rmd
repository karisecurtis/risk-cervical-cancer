## Sourced Functions
This sources all the functions we will need to ingest and tidy our data!
```{r Sourced Functions}
source(here::here("/src/ingest.R"))
```

## Ingest
This block ingests the Cervical cancer (Risk Factors) data from [UCI's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29). The data are not likely to change, so only run this once!

```{r Ingest Data, eval=FALSE}
getdata("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00383/risk_factors_cervical_cancer.csv")
```

##Tidy
```{r }
```
