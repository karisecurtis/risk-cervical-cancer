Because I should probably practice with these, here you go, Ross. :) 

## Ingests Data
This first chunk just pulls the data we ingested into the local environment.

```{r Pulls Data In}
library(magrittr)
data <- readr::read_rds(here::here("./data/tidy/tidy-data.rds"))
```


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
